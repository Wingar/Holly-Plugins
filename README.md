# Holly Plugins

This git repo is a list of plugins for HollyBot, my IRC bot.


## How this works

All plugins that will be used by Holly will be in the "Production" branch. All stuff there is added manually by me.
To get your plugin into Holly, open a pull request to the "Master" branch with your plugin.
I've provided a little example plugin to show off what I have so far on my little API. It shows both database and channel manipulation.
If you already have a plugin in production and want it updated, PR to "Master", not production.

## Everything else

If there's a suggestion you want added to the API, by all means, open an issue.
